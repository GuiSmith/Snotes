At first, the idea was to create a project where I could show my skills in WEB development.

As I continued to work on my projects, I found extreme difficulty in the front-end department. I would spend hours, days or even weeks stuck in designing what I wanted, and every time I would think it wasn't good enough or people wouldn't think it's pretty.

So I decided to focus on the back-end, the project doesn't have to be all static and not syled at all, but it doesn't have to be all pretty. That being said, I studied a little bit of bootstrap and started making use of it, deciding to use styling the least as possible.

I finished the login, register, forgot password and session control part, now I can focus on the real part of the project.

Now I'm focused on the PHP and database part, using mysql from linux.

I will finish the project and include somehing related to an API.

The API part would be about Spotify. Many times I was listening to a song so good that made me create a whole scenario in my head. Imagine if you could browse between songs and, with a click, start writing a story about it or that was inspired by it? That is what I want.

I want people to be able to just write a short note, story or a song based story.

The song based story has to be more developed.
