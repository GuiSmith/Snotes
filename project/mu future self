Ok, if you're reading this, it's probably because it has been a while since you've opened this project and you probably forgot something.
Here I am going to teach you how to use github like a human being, ok? Let's go

First, create the github repository
Second, go to the linux ubuntu's terminal
Third, go to the folder you want to push (folder project? just cd /var/www/html/php <-- the folder php will be uploaded)
Fourth, type "git init -b main"
Fifth,  add the files with "git add ."
Sixth, connect the local repository with the github repository with "git remote add origin (<-- origin may be the name of the repository, it can be just a name you can choose) github.link (<-- here is the link github will show you when you create the repository, like https://github.com/GuiSmith/notes.git)"
Seventh, commit the upload with "git commit -m 'message of the commit'"
Eigth, push the local repository with "git push origin (<-- name of the local repository) main/master (<-- not sure which one, try one then the other)"
Ninth, it will ask for your username (GuiSmith) and your access token
Tenth, check the github repository for changes

If you forgot your access token or how to create it, just go to settings, developers tool, access token, create one;
